# fontnemo Work Progress

## Current Status: ✅ v0.1.1 Updates Complete

**Latest Version:** 0.1.1 (Unreleased)
**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Status:** Enhanced timestamp functionality and documentation

## Latest Updates - 2025-11-01 Evening

### Issue #101 Implementation ✅

**Completed tasks:**

1. **✅ timestamp command enhancement**
   - Changed default separator from `" "` to `" tX"`
   - Added `--replace_timestamp` parameter (default: True)
   - When True and using default separator:
     - Removes ` tX` and everything after from family_name
     - Removes `tX` and everything after from family_slug
   - Tested and verified working correctly

2. **✅ README.md complete rewrite**
   - New structure: Installation → Why → Quick Start → Core Concepts → Commands → Technical Details
   - Added comprehensive installation section (PyPI link)
   - Added "Why fontnemo?" section explaining use cases
   - Expanded command documentation with examples
   - Added output modes section
   - Added verbose logging section
   - Improved technical details section
   - Total rewrite: ~410 lines of clear, comprehensive documentation

3. **✅ TODO.md and PLAN.md cleanup**
   - TODO.md: Removed all completed tasks, kept future enhancements organized
   - PLAN.md: Marked all completed phases with ✅, organized future phases clearly
   - Both files now accurately reflect current state

4. **✅ CHANGELOG.md made more compact**
   - Condensed from verbose format to concise, scannable format
   - Kept all important information
   - Added unreleased section for v0.1.1 changes
   - Now 36 lines (was ~170 lines)

5. **✅ CLAUDE.md kept as-is**
   - Already consistent and comprehensive
   - Contains all necessary development guidelines
   - No changes needed - working well as project instructions

### Testing Results

**Manual CLI testing:**
```bash
# Test 1: First timestamp application
$ fontnemo timestamp test.ttf
"Roboto" → "Roboto tXt51r1q"

# Test 2: Timestamp replacement (default behavior)
$ fontnemo timestamp test.ttf
"Roboto tXt51r1q" → "Roboto tXt51r2a"  # Old timestamp replaced!

# Test 3: Accumulate timestamps (opt-out of replacement)
$ fontnemo timestamp test.ttf --replace_timestamp=False
"Roboto tXt51r2a" → "Roboto tXt51r2a tXt51r2c"  # Accumulated

# Test 4: Custom separator
$ fontnemo timestamp test.ttf --separator="-"
"Roboto" → "Roboto-t51r2e"
```

**All tests pass:** ✅

**Unit tests:** 26/26 passing
**Core module coverage:** 93-95%

## Complete Feature Summary (v0.1.1)

## Version Comparison

### v0.1.0 (2025-11-01 Afternoon)
- Initial MVP release
- All 6 commands functional
- Basic timestamp with space separator
- 93-95% test coverage

### v0.1.1 (2025-11-01 Evening - Unreleased)
- Enhanced timestamp command with replacement logic
- Changed default separator to " tX"
- Added `--replace_timestamp` parameter
- Complete documentation overhaul
- All documentation files cleaned up

## Project Statistics (Current)

**Code:**
- Source: ~480 lines (4 files) - +30 lines for timestamp enhancement
- Tests: ~400 lines (2 files)
- Documentation: ~1200 lines (6 .md files) - reorganized and streamlined

**Dependencies:** 8 total (3 production, 3 dev, 2 build)

**Test Coverage:**
- Core modules (utils.py, core.py): 93-95% ✅
- Overall: 50% (CLI not tested via unit tests, but manually verified)

## What Works Perfectly

**All features from v0.1.0 plus:**
- ✅ Smart timestamp replacement (removes old before adding new)
- ✅ Configurable replacement behavior
- ✅ Custom separator support with conditional replacement
- ✅ Comprehensive, user-friendly documentation

## Outstanding Items

**None for v0.1.1.** All issue #101 tasks completed.

**Future enhancements** (see TODO.md):
- Batch processing
- Configuration file support
- Dry-run mode
- CLI integration tests

## Ready for Release

**v0.1.1 is ready when:**
- ✅ All code changes implemented
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Manual testing complete
- [ ] Git tag created: `v0.1.1`
- [ ] PyPI release published

## Notes

### Timestamp Replacement Logic

The new timestamp replacement feature makes iterative font development much cleaner:

**Before (v0.1.0):**
```
Run 1: "My Font" → "My Font t51r1v"
Run 2: "My Font t51r1v" → "My Font t51r1v t51r2a"
Run 3: "My Font t51r1v t51r2a" → "My Font t51r1v t51r2a t51r2c"
```

**After (v0.1.1 with default behavior):**
```
Run 1: "My Font" → "My Font tXt51r1v"
Run 2: "My Font tXt51r1v" → "My Font tXt51r2a"
Run 3: "My Font tXt51r2a" → "My Font tXt51r2c"
```

Much cleaner! The " tX" prefix makes timestamps easy to identify and remove.

### Documentation Philosophy

The rewritten README.md follows the principle:
1. **What** it is (brief intro)
2. **How to install** (immediate actionability)
3. **Why** use it (motivation)
4. **Quick start** (immediate success)
5. **Concepts** (understanding)
6. **Commands** (reference)
7. **Technical details** (depth)

This structure serves both newcomers and experienced users.
